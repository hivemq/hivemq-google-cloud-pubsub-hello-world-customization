= HiveMQ Google Cloud Pub/Sub Extension Hello World Customization

== Purpose

This Hello World customization uses two transformers.

- One `mqtt-to-pubsub` transformer that forwards MQTT publish messages to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
This transformer reads the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic from the custom settings of the `config.xml` file and preserves the MQTT topic,
retained flag, QoS level, and user properties as Pub/Sub message attributes.
- One `pubsub-to-mqtt` transformer that forwards Pub/Sub messages to HiveMQ.
This transformer reads the QoS level from the custom settings of the `config.xml` file, uses the `mqtt/topic` as the MQTT topic, and preserves
every Pub/Sub attribute as MQTT user properties.

== Installation

. Clone this repository into a Java 11 Gradle project.
. Run the `./gradlew jar` task from Gradle to build the customization.
. Move the `build/libs/hivemq-google-cloud-pubsub-hello-world-customization-4.9.0.jar` file to the  `HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-google-cloud-pubsub-extension/customizations` directory.
. Copy the `src/main/resources/google-cloud-pubsub-configuration.xml` file to the `HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-google-cloud-pubsub-extension` folder.
. Adapt the configuration to your environment.
    - Set the `<google-cloud-project-id>` in the `<pubsub-connection>` tag to match your Google Cloud Pub/Sub project ID.
    - Set the `<file-path>` in the `<service-account>` tag to the absolute or relative path of your `service-account-key.json` file.
    - Set the `<pubsub-subscription>` name in the `<pubsub-to-mqtt-transformer>` tag to match the correct Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription.
    - Set the `<value>` of the destination `<custom-setting>` in the `<mqtt-to-pubsub-transformer>` to the correct Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
. Delete the `HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-google-cloud-pubsub-extension/DISABLED` file (if there is one).
. Start HiveMQ.

== First Steps

=== Manually Test Your MQTT-to-Pub/Sub Mapping

- Connect with an {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice.
- Publish an MQTT message to the topic `topic/test`.
- Monitor the topic you configured in your Google Cloud Pub/Sub project for a received message. (Hint: Pub/Sub topics must have subscriptions or a message retention duration set for messages to be stored)

=== Manually Test Your Pub/Sub-to-MQTT Mapping

- Connect with an {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice.
- Subscribe to the topic `mqtt/topic`.
- Publish a Pub/Sub message to the Pub/Sub topic.
- Verify that you receive an MQTT message with your client.
